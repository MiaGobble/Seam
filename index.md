## What is Seam?
Seam is a Roblox UI framework managed by declarative states and components, built for ease of use and flexibility. Whether you're making something simple or scaled, Seam can handle it!

With Seam, you can:
* Declaratively or mock-declaratively create your in-game UI/UX
* Create reactive user input using animation states
* Make scopes to contain UI functionality in designated spaces for easy cleanup
* Declare components and have them usable in any context
* And more!

## Why use Seam?
Seam is easier to use than most other frameworks, and is built with flexibility in mind. You no longer need to worry about a mess of dependencies, weird syntax, or difficult use-cases.

> [!CAUTION]
> Warning! Seam is not yet production ready and future versions may not be backwards-compatible. If you choose to use it on larger projects, keep this in mind.

## Bear in mind...
Seam is early in development and things can change at any time. Documentation is also unfinished.
