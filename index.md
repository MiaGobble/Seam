## What is Seam?
Seam is a Roblox UI framework managed by declarative states and components, built for ease of use and flexibility. Whether you're making something simple or scaled, Seam can handle it!

With Seam, you can:
* Declaratively or mock-declaratively create your in-game UI/UX
* Create reactive user input using animation states
* Make scopes to contain UI functionality in designated spaces for easy cleanup
* Use custom-made components
* And more!

## Bear in mind...
Seam is early in development and things can change at any time. Documentation is also unfinished.
