## From
* Type: Other
* Since: 0.0.1
* Scopeable: No

## Usage
It's recommended that you import `From` from the Seam module so that you can use it later on:

```lua
local Seam = require(ReplicatedFirst.Seam)
local From = Seam.From
```

`From` is a callback used in the `New` constructor to call back to an already-declared component. You can read about this in the documentation for `DeclareComponent`, which is linked [here](./declarecomponent.md).
